# Plans and ideas

## Concepts

* Try to address tho use cases of existing users
* Outreach to new areas with low income over the digital divide

## Software

### User features

* ability to bookmark subsections of a podcast
* share deep links or media slices to subsections
* recommendation engine

### WAN

* WebTorrent
* bootstrap: supernodes

### Offline

* sync schedule
* prefetch as podcast: subscribe to concrete shows, general show tags, keywords in description
* after transcript is available (or generated), fetch other recent podcasts that may be of interest for later listening as well
* decompose podcast to subsections: add comments to a given point in time of a podcast that may sync to a forum or mailing list thread in batches

### Bandwidth saving

* also reduces power consumption
* when available, stream the source of tracked modules, not their rendered forms
* decompose live shows as tracked modules: prefetch static assets in high quality (musical interludes, effects, questions by host), overlay speech in realtime with lower bandwidth codec

### Business model

* resale of FM transmitter for home or automotive use with a markup
* sponsorship subscription that provides a small cellular data plan (while subscribed) and hardware (from loan)

## Hardware

### Car

* phone/mifi (SBC, storage, Bluetooth, wifi, 4G modem)
* 3.5mm jack line cable
* FM transmitter
* 4G subscription
* USB car cigarette lighter charger

### Kitchen

* phone/mifi (SBC, storage, Bluetooth, wifi)
* 3.5mm jack line cable
* FM transmitter
* speaker (or built-in)
* Bluetooth keyboard (or built-in touchscreen)

### Nomadic

* phone/mifi (SBC, storage, Bluetooth, wifi, 4G modem)
* 4G subscription
* 3.5mm jack line cable
* FM transmitter
* speaker (or built-in)
* Bluetooth keyboard (or built-in touchscreen)
* powerbank (battery, LED torch, solar panel, USB charger)
* USB-OTG cable

### Digital divide

* possibly shared within family: speaker box with MP3 player or phone, jack line cable, wired speaker
* possibly shared within family: USB SD card reader, USB cable, USB-OTG cable
* personal SD card or USB thumb flash drive (perhaps USB-OTG): possibly shared with separate encrypted folders
* periodically drive into a computer with Internet access (community center, office, school), let the website or portable executable app sync new content automatically based on personal profile

### Existing

Most components and full systems already exist on the market with wifi based internet radio streaming built in. Such could also be resold as a first step before creating more elaborate custom solutions.
